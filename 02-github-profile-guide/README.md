Explore how to create an impressive **Github Profile**

**Step 1**: Pick a professional `username`

Github is a professional platform that offers an excellent platform for recruiters to connect with potential candidates, therefore it's critical to ensure that your github username is **professional** and is really **searchable**

Using your **full name** as your `username` is a recommended practice. This allows recruiters to find you quickly and associate your github profile with your linkedin or other professional platforms

- Should avoid twitter handles etc. or anything that's not a variable of your name
- Should avoid usernames with random numbers, special characters, or overly complex names

**Step 2**: Pick a professional Profile Picture

Using a high quality and professional photo is essential, because this adds a personal touch (creates a first positive impression). So use a real photo of you (try not to use selfies or other people in it), if possible use the same photo that you use on your other professional profiles such as linkedin. This consistency will help recruiters easily recognize you

**Step 3**: Set your status (Github status)

If you are a programmer looking for a job remember to set your status on github accordingly. Let recruiters know that you are available for opportunities, this way they know that they can approach you

**Step 4**: Don't forget to add personal information and links

When completing your github profile you will find many fields to fill including company, portfolio, contact email nad socials (it's essential to provide accurate and update information)

If you're unemployed you can list your affirmation with for example the js mastery to indicate your participation in maybe a coding boot camp

**Step 5** Incorporate your location into your profile

This helps recruiters understand your geographical location and potential time zone differences

**Step 6** Include your email

Additional including your email address is vital for recruiters to contact you directly. You also have options to add links to your social accounts, websites or portfolio

**Step 7** Write a Bio (Github Bio)

Fill in a `Bio` that represents your role, keep it simple and straight forward. This could be your:

- Current job title
- Or something that shows who you are

Example:

```txt
I'm a software engineer in Chain.(flag) Currently, I'm working for Microsoft, focusing on M365
infrastructure. I enjoy coding for fun(emoji) and making toy projects
```

Or more Professional

```txt
product @vercel;maintainer of @ligit2. Formerly product and engineering at @github, @microsoft
```

Avoid using words like "new developer", "junior developer" or "recent graduate"

Include information where you are currently working or have previously worked (if you don'y have these add technologies you are skilled in)

**Step 8** Your projects

Showcase your personal projects they're a reflection of your creativity and passion for coding

**Step 9** Try contributing to open source

Enrich your github profile by contributing to open source projects

Tip:

- Feature Repositories always pin the best ones. Featuring repositories with coding projects is a key aspect of a strong github profile
- Focus on quality over quantity
- Adding descriptions for your pinned projects is essential to an engaging profile. Each project description provides a quick understanding of what the project is all about(it has be concise yet informative). Highlight the project key features and the technologies used
- Have great Readme files for your pinned projects (Each pinned project should have a detailed Readme file that introduces the project and explains it's purpose). It's like a manual on how your project can used and what it does. Including **illustrations** and **visuals** in the readme can further enhance the appeal of your projects. Make your readme:
  - User friendly and engaging
  - Use clear language
  - Organize the information in a way that's easy to follow
  - Provide a link to a live site
- Choose meaningful and clear names for your projects
- Tag your projects with relevant keywords eg node.js, next.js, etc
- Can also add emojis
- Encourage others to appreciate your work by giving your project **stars**
- Keep focus on what matters

A well crafted Readme includes:

- Purpose and Goal - A readme should clearly explain the purpose of the code and outline the project goals
- Project development - Here you can explain how the development process went
- Contribution Guidance - Provide guidance on how to contribute, explain how to install the code and set it up
- Ingoing Project Needs - you can mention what features you want to add or what features other can contribute to improve the project
- Code standards and best practices - If your project certain code of standard mention it in the readme
- Licensing Information
- Documentation and usage examples
- Contact Information - So that other people can reach out to you.
- Project Roadmap - Covering the features you wanna add in the future
- Acknowledgments and credits
- Formatting and clarity

Important:

- Mind you commits - consistent is critical for maintaining a professional github profile. So commits have to be **Clear, Concise and meaningful**

Examples of Good Commit messages

```txt
1. feat: Add user authentication feature

2. fix: Resolve issue with form validation

3. feat: Implement payment processing API integration

# Logical Grouping of changes

1. refactor: Reorganize file structure

# Code Review Changes

1. style: Refactor variable name per code review feedback

# Merge Conflict Resolution

merge: Resolve conflicts in feature-branch
```

## ENV Files

> Protecting information

Including ENV files in public repositories can have serious implications such as

- Security Concerns
- Vulnerability to Attacks
- Legal and Compliance Issues

Best Practices

- Store ENV files locally
- use `.gitignore` file
- Provide an example ENV file
- Documentation (and with instructions)

By following these best practices, you demonstrate professionalism, responsible coding practices and commitment to security and privacy

Now all these things are going to open doors to open source, where you can contribute and collaborate, this is key to an awesome github profile
