    <h1>What's a staple? The list expands.</h1>

    <p>
      Conventional agricultural wisdom holds that only a handful of crop species
      -- as few as 7 and no more than 30, depending on different assessments --
      account for most of the plant food consumed by humanity. But a new study
      says more than 100 species and possibly as many as 200 are important food
      sources.
