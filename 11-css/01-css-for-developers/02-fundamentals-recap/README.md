# Fundamentals Recap

## 1. Anatomy of a Style Rule

```css
.error-text {
  color: red;
}
```

## 2. Media Queries

In order to accommodate screens of different shapes and sizes, `CSS` features `media queries`, which allow us to apply different `CSS` in different scenarios

Media queries use the @media syntax. You can kinda think of it as an if statement in JavaScript, for example

```js
// Javascript
if (condition) {
  // Some JS that will run if the condition is met.
}
```

```css
/* CSS */
@media (condition) {
  /* Some CSS that'll run if the condition is met. */
}
```

Example

```css
@media (max-width: 300px) {
  .small-only {
    color: red;
  }
}
```

Breakdown:

- In this case, the condition is `max-width: 300px`. If the **window is between 0px and 300px wide**, the CSS within will be applied.

### 1. Hiding content

It's common to use `media queries` to have alternative interfaces depending on the screen size.

### 2. Valid conditions

Inside the parentheses, we typically use either `max-width` **to add styles on small screens**, or `min-width` **to add styles on larger ones**.

Note:

- In the context of a media query, max-width is a ‚Äúmedia feature‚Äù, not a CSS property. They just happen to share the same name

Not all CSS properties have corresponding media features. For example, this snippet is not valid:

```css
/* üö´ Not valid, since `font-size` can't be queried */
@media (font-size: 32px) {
}
```

Tip:

- An `iframe` is an embedded HTML document within the main HTML document. It's a page within a page. When you resize the partition between code and preview, you're resizing the embedded document. The media query runs in the context of that inner page.

## 3. Selectors

`CSS` comes with an incredibly rich set of `selectors`, and those `selectors` can be mixed and matched in interesting ways.

The most straightforward `selectors` target a specific tag or class

```css
/* Turn all links red! */
a {
  color: red;
}
/*
  Remove the underline from all elements that
  have been given a class of `navigation-link`
*/
.navigation-link {
  text-decoration: none;
}
```

Tip:
-Within the modern JS ecosystem, however, we often rely on tooling to generate these selectors for us (we'll cover this in more depth in Module 3). For this reason, we won't focus too much on them in this course.
