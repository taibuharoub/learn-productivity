# New to a Mac

## Basic Elements

## How to right click, secondary click, control click

When you say you want to right click on a mac what you really mean is that ypu want to use a secondary click

- if you use `one` finger to click down then it's the `left` click or `primary` click
- then two fingers symbolize the `right` click or `secondary` click

There is another way to trigger a `secondary` click, this option requires you to hold down the `control` key and then perform a simple `primary` click (in other ways holding `control` and clicking on the left side of your mouse or just a single finger tap on the trackpad)

When you use a `secondary` click, it will bring up the `context menu`
