# Perfect Landing Page Design Explained

> What to exactly put on the home page of your website

## Section 1: Hero Section

> The top most section of the website

This is called above the fold before you have to scroll to anything, this is the most important thing because if we don't get this right, people are not going to continue scrolling

### 1. Title

The first we obviously have is the title, this needs to explain the value that your're providing. Now this doesn't necessarily always mean to say what you're doing because if you might be doing something generic like i sell cars or i build websites or we sell coffee, that might be generic so **you need to explain the value the uniqueness of it**, so that can be the problem you're solving for example like i will generate more traffic for your business or our coffee is uniquely made by blah blah

So this is where you explain the value or what happens when you're going to drink the coffee, so this is value and we want to start off with this

### 2. Subtitle

Now below this we always have a sub-title, and the purpose of the subtitle is to actually explain how this value is being created eg here you might say i drive more sales to by your business by building a high converting website and sometimes you might even who this is for so i do this for small businesses or this is good for entrepreneurs and so forth

So this is the purpose of having a subtitle in your hero section

### 3. Visual

The next thing that you ant to have is some kind of a visual, and the point of the visual is to **help them imagine what it is that they're buying**, obviously if it's a product you want to show the product and more specifically you might even want to show the product in use so they can image that that's them using it

If you're a service provider you might want to see the experience of working with you, so if you're a freelancer may be that's a photo of you so people can imagine who is the person they are hiring

### 4. Social Proof

> Make it believable

In this example i have eg "5,000 people like you have purchased this product"

And the point of this is to make it believable. Now we don't always have this sometimes you will see maybe logos of companies that we have worked with or some numbers like x numbers sold.

But the point of this again is to **make it credible**, to make it your claims credible

### 5. Call to action

Which is basically a button that tells them what to do next, should i get started, should i book a call, should i buy this now. But you want to easily tell people what to do next otherwise they might just leave the website and be lost

Now above are the core elements of a hero section

## Section 2: Features and Benefits

The next stuff you wanna talk about is features and benefits which is you have a very big claim at the top(a promise) now how you're going to deliver on this, how this actually works

Now the difference between features and benefits

- So features are the technical specs of what this is, but usually don't care about the technical, they want to know what's the benefit if i use this, what's going to happen  (it can be short, it can be long)

## Section 3: More Social Proof

you wanna so show additional social proof and in this case it's testimonials, and again this can be logos, testimonials, numbers, whatever you want

## Section 4: FAQ - Frequently Asked Questioned/Headline Objections

And the reason why we have this to handle objections, you think of a landing page as a sales presentation, we're trying to sell some idea, some products and services

We'll use the FAQ to predict the objects that visitors might have, tackle them and answer them and that's going to increase the likelihood that they purchase

## Section 5: Last Call to Action

Which is now you are convinced that and buy now, you never wanna leave them at the end of the page without telling them oce again what they need to do right now

## Section 6: Footer

Lastly on every page is a footer, which basically tells them what else is on this website eg subscribe to a newsletter or something like this, but it's just like an organizational tool
